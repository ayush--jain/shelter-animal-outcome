##SHELTER ANIMAL OUTCOME

Project credits: Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/shelter-animal-outcomes)

Every year, approximately 7.6 million companion animals end up in US shelters. Many animals are given up as unwanted by their owners, while others are picked up after getting lost or taken out of cruelty situations. Many of these animals find forever families to take them home, but just as many are not so lucky. 2.7 million dogs and cats are euthanized in the US every year.

Using a dataset of intake information including breed, color, sex, and age from the Austin Animal Center, I attempt to predict the outcome for each animal.

Algorithm used: random forest (python-sklearn)

Accuracy achieved: 62.5% (accuracy_score) and â€‹1.34915 (log_loss score)
